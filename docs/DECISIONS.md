## D-001: Build on FABulous
- **Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Status:** Proposed (confirm in phase 0)
- **Decision:** Use FABulous for fabric generation, synthesis mapping, place and route, and bitstream generation, pinned to one release.
- **Reason:** Open source, supports custom fabrics and primitives, has a physical implementation flow and IHP precedent, and has been used on Tiny Tapeout before (Tiny FABulous).
- **Alternatives:** OpenFPGA (not developed in parallel); writing a fabric and toolchain from scratch (too much work for the schedule).
- **Evidence:** to be added in phase 0 (reference fabric demo).

## D-002: Domain-specific but protocol-agnostic
- **Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Specialize the fabric for protocol emulation, but never add a dedicated protocol block. Hard blocks and cell features must be general primitives useful to more than one protocol. Each addition needs profiling data, benefiting protocols, area cost, and cost to non-users.
- **Reason:** The brief rules out "a UART block, an SPI block and an I2C block"; generality after fabrication is the point.

## D-003: Design set and sealed held-out set
- **Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Optimize the architecture on a design set (UART, SPI controller, I2C controller, I2C target). Evaluate generality on a held-out set chosen and committed in phase 1, untouched until the hardware freeze.
- **Reason:** Without a held-out set, a specialized fabric can overfit to the protocols it was tuned on, and the generality claim can't be checked.

## D-004: Equal-area comparison
- **Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Architecture variants are compared at equal total area (fabric, configuration, routing, shell) and equal clock target.
- **Reason:** A variant using fewer LUTs is not better if its hard blocks cost more area than the LUTs saved.

## D-005: G0 is the fallback submission
- **Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** The generic baseline fabric with the complete shell (phase 2) must be a valid, submittable chip before any specialization work.
- **Reason:** Guarantees a working entry if specialization runs late.

## D-006: Provisional pin allocation
- **Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Status:** Proposed (finalized in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §1, phase 1)
- **Decision:** Shell host interface on `ui[0]` CS_N, `ui[1]` SCK, `ui[2]` MOSI, `uo[0]` MISO, `uo[1]` IRQ. Everything else goes to the fabric: `ui[3..7]` (5 inputs), `uo[2..7]` (6 outputs), `uio[0..7]` (8 bidirectional, needed for open-drain I2C and 1-Wire).
- **Reason:** the TT `check-docs` step rejects an empty pinout, so `info.yaml` needs a pinout before the spec exists. SPI-like host port with polled status per OVERVIEW; IRQ is optional and can be dropped.
- **Alternatives:** host port on `uio` (costs bidirectional pins the protocols need); a 2-wire host port (fewer pins, slower loads).
- **Cost:** 5 of 24 pins go to the shell.
- **Evidence:** none yet; revisit with the pin needs of the design set and the showcase.

## D-007: Local tool PATH order
- **Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** System `/usr/bin` comes first; `~/oss-cad-suite/bin` is appended to the end of PATH (`scripts/check_all.sh` and `scripts/gl_local.sh` do this themselves). Python runs only in `.venv`.
- **Reason:** CI's `test` and `lint` jobs use Ubuntu 24.04's apt Icarus 12.0 and Verilator 5.020, which are also the WSL system versions. The OSS CAD Suite ships its own newer Icarus and Verilator; appending it keeps the CI versions in front while still providing Yosys, nextpnr and SymbiYosys.
- **Evidence:** local `iverilog -V` 12.0, `verilator --version` 5.020 (Debian 5.020-1); `scripts/check_all.sh` and `scripts/gl_local.sh` pass (2026-09-25). Versions in `docs/VERSIONS.md`.
