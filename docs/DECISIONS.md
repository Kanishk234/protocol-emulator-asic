# TRIPWIRE decisions

Newest at the bottom. Each entry: date, decision, reason, alternatives, status.
A spec change is proposed here first and implemented only after the team agrees.

## D-001 (2026-09-22): architecture is TRIPWIRE
- **Decision:** build TRIPWIRE: triggered reflex lanes (no program counter on the fast path), SRAM routines, a multicast channel fabric and timed pin units. See `design/OVERVIEW_TRIPWIRE.md` and `design/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Reason:** novel in the field (triggered execution and the multicast fabric), with a fixed, provable pin-to-pin reaction time and program-level static checks.
- **Alternatives:** PIO-style state machines, a barrel CPU (both well covered by other entries).
- **Status:** accepted.

## D-002 (2026-09-23): top module name `tt_um_tripwire`
- **Decision:** keep `tt_um_tripwire` as the top module.
- **Reason:** team choice; matches the project name.
- **Risk:** Tiny Tapeout asks for a unique name, usually by including the GitHub username. If the shuttle reports a clash, rename to `tt_um_<username>_tripwire` (a mechanical change: `src/`, `info.yaml`, `test/tb.v`).
- **Status:** accepted.

## D-003 (2026-09-23): questions to Jane Street (tile size, SRAM macro)
- **Questions:** (a) is 8x4 available, or should we design for 6x4; (b) are IHP SRAM macros accepted on the target shuttle.
- **Assumption until answered:** 6x4 with the 512x16 SRAM macro, keeping the flop-store fallback (`design/PHYSICAL_DESIGN_AND_CI.md` §3).
- **Status:** email not yet sent (phase 0 task 18). Record the answers and date here.

## D-004 (2026-09-23): local toolchain
- **Decision:**
  - Python always runs from the project venv `.venv` (`scripts/setup_venv.sh`); packages pinned in `requirements-dev.txt` and `test/requirements.txt`.
  - OSS CAD Suite build 20260914 at `~/oss-cad-suite`, its `bin` **appended** to PATH (Verilator 5.053, Yosys 0.69, SymbiYosys, Yices, Boolector, Bitwuzla, mcy).
  - Icarus Verilog is the system package (12.0), the same one the CI `test` job installs from apt; appending the suite keeps it first on PATH.
- **Reason:** local results should match CI; the venv keeps the system Python clean.
- **Status:** accepted.

## D-005 (2026-09-23): no placeholder folders
- **Decision:** `spec/`, `tools/`, `programs/`, `test_internal/`, `formal/` and `macro/` are created when their first real file is added, not up front with placeholder READMEs. The target layout stays as listed in `design/phases/PHASE0_SETUP.md` task 6.
- **Reason:** keep the repo free of empty scaffolding; the layout is not a phase 0 exit item.
- **Note:** `macro/` is in the `gds` trigger paths, so adding it starts a hardening.
- **Status:** accepted.

## Open questions for the phase 1 spec freeze
Found while reading the design docs; to be settled in `ARCHITECTURE.md` during P1.
- **Q1: routine steps vs. reflexes.** §6.2 says a routine step runs only on a clock when *no* reflex fires; §6.3 and the overview say *urgent* reflexes interrupt routines. What exactly does `U=0` block while RB is set?
- **Q2: CALL is encoded twice**, as `OP=15` and as `DST=7`. Keep one.
- **Q3: `MKCTL` cannot build `LEVEL 1` / `OE 1`.** MKCTL (§5.3) produces `{IMM[7:4], 0, A[10:0]}`, forcing data bit 11 to 0, but the pin-unit `LEVEL` and `OE` ops (§7.3) take their value from bit 11. Options: pass `A[11:0]` through, or take bit 11 from an IMM bit.
- **Q4: routine B format is too narrow.** `cond[11:9]` is 3 bits, but `BF f` / `BNF f` need a branch kind plus a 2-bit flag index, and `DJNZ r` needs a 2-bit register (§6.1). Needs at least 4 bits, or fewer branch kinds / flags.
- **Q5: routines have no compare or bitfield ops.** §4.4 of the overview says routines use the same operations as reflexes, but the R format only covers ops 0–7. There is no `CMPEQ`/`CMPM`/`TSTZ`/`PAR`/`EXT`/`SHOR` in routines, so a routine cannot set a flag from data. The 16 routine opcodes are all used, so adding these needs a sub-opcode field or dropping something.
- **Q6: `OTAG` shares bits with the immediate.** With `OTAG=1` the output tag comes from `IMM[7:6]`, so a slot that emits a CTRL/EVENT/ERR token with `BSEL=1` is limited to immediates 0–63. Decide whether that is acceptable or give the tag its own bits (the slot is 51 bits in a 64-bit host word space, so there is room).
